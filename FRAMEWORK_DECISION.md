I am familiar with flask and have used it before. Streamlit I have heard of but I have never used it. 

Flask is customizable but requires tweaking, adjusting, and perfecting to get right. Additionally, flask requires the user to install several dependencies before being able to run the program with flask. This means that in order to share the file and have other users run the web app, they must install all dependencies before they can run it. If they do not know how to do that, documentation and instructions are also required for the program.

In comparison, streamlit is less customizable, but it is more user friendly. It has many different formats to use for any project. It is focused more on UI where flask is focused more on running it on the web. Sharing with other users does not require as many dependencies to be installed before use. 

Flask for programs between groups or peers, streamlit for sharing with all users.
