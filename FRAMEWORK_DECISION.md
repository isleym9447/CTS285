I am familiar with flask and have used it before. Streamlit I have heard of but I have never used it. Flask is customizable but requires tweaking, adjusting, and perfecting to get right.
Additionally, flask requires the user to install several dependencies before being able to run the program with flask. 

In comparison, streamlit is less customizable, but it is more user friendly. It has many different formats to use for any project. It is focused more on UI where flask is focused more on running it on the web.
