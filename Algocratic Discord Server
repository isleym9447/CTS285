Hey Teacherbot!,
I created a separate Discord account aside from my personal one so the messages here would be from Algocratic and not from me. And I will give you all account info for this dicsord account and the email I made attached to it so you can have it for this year and the future years! If you want to delete everything and have it be from your personal teaherbot discord account thats totally fine.  You can use all of what I did, some of it, or none of it. Whichever you prefer. 

-Mattea,
Provided I did everything correctly, this is what I did.

The self-proclaimed Teacherbot section is for you, any user with the role permission of admin, and the owner account (this one, I call it Algo).  
No other role has permission to view it. When adding users, make sure to give them clearance level roles. The clearance level roles infrared-yellow 
all have the SAME permissions: view channels, change, nickname, send messages and create posts , send messages in threads and posts , attach files, 
read, message history, connect to voice, speak in voice, share video, and use voice activity. The roles Teacherbot, and Admin have all permissions granted. 
This user (Algo) has all permissions granted as it is the server owner. I will give you all info for this account and the email used for this account. 
I created a separate Algocratic entity to make the base of the server. But I/you can totally transfer the server ownership over to your teacherbot discord account too. 


In the Teacherbot section, the ⁠system text channel has system updates. The ⁠change-log text channel is just that, a changelog. 
Both of with have their permissions set to only teacherbot and admins per the teacherbot category. 
-
In the Orientation section, all channels are view only for inafrared-yellow. As always, teacherbot, admin, and algo have all permissions. The ⁠welcome text channel is where 
the log of who enters the channel is kept along with welcome messages. The ⁠about-algocratic text channel is an in universe blurb about Algocratic. I took it directly copy 
pasted from the class on canvas. The ⁠instructor-info is taken directly from the syllabus. The ⁠intern-manual is some FAQs and how to use discord. I may add some how to use canvas 
and how to use github? The ⁠resources is useful links like bots and the FTCC website. 
-
In the Corp Communications section, the ⁠annoucements text channel is read only for infrared-yellow and all permissions for teacherbot, admin, and Algo. ⁠questions and ⁠off-topic are open to everyone.

Rules:
Corporate Protocol (Server Rules)

Respect the Algorithm (and each other).
Treat all interns, staff, and Teacherbot with professionalism. Harassment, bullying, or disrespect will not be tolerated.

No Corrupted Data (a.k.a. swearing or inappropriate content).
Keep language professional and content safe for an academic workspace.

Integrity Above All.
Cheating, plagiarism, or sharing unauthorized answers is strictly forbidden. Collaboration is encouraged only where Teacherbot approves.

Maintain Security Clearance.
Do not impersonate higher roles or access areas outside your clearance. If you need additional access, request it through proper channels.

Use Proper Channels.
Homework in #assignments, questions in #classwork, banter in #off-topic. Keep communications organized so the Algorithm runs smoothly.

Confidentiality Required.
Do not share screenshots, conversations, or documents from this server outside Algocratic Corp without permission.

Optimize Bandwidth.
No spamming, flooding, or excessive use of GIFs/stickers. The Algorithm dislikes inefficiency.

Break Room ≠ Chaos Zone.
Off-topic chatter belongs in designated casual channels. Even there, respect Rule 1.

Teacherbot Has Final Authority.
Instructions from Teacherbot (professor) or SysAdmins (moderators) override all other protocols.

Praise the Algorithm.
Optional, but strongly encouraged. A little corporate loyalty goes a long way.
