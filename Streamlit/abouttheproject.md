# About This Project #

Archetypes of the Psyche grew out of my love for storytelling, OC creation, and the deeper question behind all self-inserts: what do the characters we create say about us? 
Fiction shapes us, and we shape fiction in return — and the choices we make inside our favorite worlds (our OCs, the media we love, the roles we gravitate toward) reveal internal 
archetypes, desires, fears, and patterns we don’t always notice directly. This project is my way of exploring that looping relationship: the psychology inside immersion, and the immersion 
inside psychology. It’s also personally meaningful to me because it blends my introspective creative world with my technical world for the first time — a project where self-reflection and software development meet.

This is the basic MVP, built in Streamlit, but it’s the foundation for a much larger vision. In the future, this project will grow into a full cloud-based application with Python + Flask backend, 
user authentication, a secure database, and Linux automation on the server side. I plan to integrate AI/NLP to analyze OCs, preferences, fanfiction snippets, or media choices and generate 
symbolic archetype insights. Additional modules will include narrative analytics dashboards, a microservice written in Java, optional C++ performance modules, cloud deployment on AWS or Azure,
CI/CD pipelines, and features that examine patterns over time — all culminating in a polished, interactive tool that demonstrates everything I’ve learned: Python, Java, JavaScript, 
HTML/CSS, C++, cloud management, databases, Linux, and applied AI. This is just the beginning, but the heart of the project remains the same: to explore who we are through the characters and stories we choose.

Introspective Immersion? Immersive Introspection?

What are you talking about? What is that?

These terms describe the two-way relationship between you and the fiction you love. Introspective immersion is when you dive into 
stories, games, and characters not just for escape, but because immersion helps you process emotions, explore identity, or find comfort. 
Immersive introspection, on the other hand, happens when fiction reflects something back at you — when the choices you make inside a story, 
the OCs you create, or the roles you gravitate toward reveal hidden patterns, desires, fears, or parts of your personality you didn’t realize 
were influencing you. Together, these ideas form the foundation of this project: exploring how we shape the stories we enter, and how those stories quietly shape us in return.
