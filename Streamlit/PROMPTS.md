can you take the original app.py and put the archetype quiz functionality into the new archetype_quiz.py file?

quick question, i forget: if im sharing this program through a github repo, do i have to include the venv folder in my files for it to work on their machine?

here is what i have so far for my streamlit app. help me add another page. create another page for "profile". Have Name: [username], above it have a profile photo. if not taken the archetype quiz its blank with the words "take archetype quiz to unlock!". after the archetype quiz is taken, depending on what result they got, it gives them the photo hero.png, innocent.png, antihero.png, mentor.png, villian.png.
this should all be in a new file called profile.py

personal favorite: "my vs code literally hates me. help."
